; ### Commutativity rules

(rewrite (BvAdd a b) (BvAdd b a) :ruleset safe)
(rewrite (BvMul a b) (BvMul b a) :ruleset safe)

; ### Explosive associativity rules

(birewrite (BvAdd a (BvAdd b c)) (BvAdd (BvAdd a b) c) :ruleset unsafe)
(birewrite (BvMul a (BvMul b c)) (BvMul (BvMul a b) c) :ruleset unsafe)
